      <description>March 21st was World Poetry Day and what, with one thing and another, we completely forgot about it. But better late than never, right? So, to tickle our creative sensibilities during this time of quarantining/ social-distancing &amp;amp; also because yesterday was World Poetry Day, we decided to have a little poetry submission thing going!

      <description>How We Ran our First Online Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore Event - 1: Identify number of possible participants This is important because it lets you make decisions about the total event&amp;rsquo;s duration and also, Step 3 depends on this because if you&amp;rsquo;re using a free service, each of them have a different limit. We have an offline limit of 20. So I decided to keep it at 10-12 this time. We had a max of 12 people at any given period this time.</description>
