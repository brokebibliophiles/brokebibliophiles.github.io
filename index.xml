      <description>The 37th meetup of BBB and the 1st meetup of the year happened on the 31st of Jan. We had a couple of newbies and also Deepti Srivatsa, who happens to be the author of a Crime novel called &amp;ldquo;The Hauntup&amp;rdquo;! The discussion also meandered into talking, among other things, about authors who build interlinked worlds in their noves a la Brandon Sanderson and also whether or not movies that end up having multiple sequels are cashgrabs or actually have significance.</description>

      <description>The 34th meetup of BBB happened on the 25th of October and we had a fun and spirited discussion as always! Some of these books Have been discussed before but that didn&amp;rsquo;t prevent us from exploring their existence from perspectives we hadn&amp;rsquo;t before - for e.g. translated works - Is there necessarily a possibility of the source and the translator having different levels of importance? Or do they play an equal role?</description>

      <description>Our 31st meetup in all and our third meetup online was a small informal meetup that quickly escalated into a discussion of books! A lot of history, and non-fiction this time, with a dash of fiction. And that, is one good recipe for an awesome discussion. One of the books on this list opens up closer home,an amazing work of fiction penned by a BBB member and a friend of ours - John Raju :) ; the book in question being The Purgatory of Half Forgotten Riddles.</description>

      <description>March 21st was World Poetry Day and what, with one thing and another, we completely forgot about it. But better late than never, right? So, to tickle our creative sensibilities during this time of quarantining/ social-distancing &amp;amp; also because yesterday was World Poetry Day, we decided to have a little poetry submission thing going! And you people submitted such lovely poems :)
In no particular order, here are all the submissions -</description>

      <description>How We Ran our First Online Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore Event - 1: Identify number of possible participants This is important because it lets you make decisions about the total event&amp;rsquo;s duration and also, Step 3 depends on this because if you&amp;rsquo;re using a free service, each of them have a different limit. We have an offline limit of 20. So I decided to keep it at 10-12 this time. We had a max of 12 people at any given period this time.</description>

      <description>The first Meetup of 2020 and our 26th meetup in all, this one had a nice mixture of newbies and regulars. Amid cheesy chilli pops and coffee, much was discussed about the law, Indian authors and much fiction and non-fiction. We even had some people flit in and sit in randomly because they saw us discussing books. Another interesting observation was the reference to books discussed in earlier meetups.</description>

      <description>This was a special meetup for a couple of reasons.
 This was the first meetup that was conducted at a house rather than at a cafe or a park. And when one of our members, Gayathri, generously offered up her art studio as a venue for our meetup I jumped at the offer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how it would go because we&amp;rsquo;d always relied on snacks and beverages from a cafe.</description>

      <description>There were 17 people at our 24th meetup on the 24th of November and this time, we were joined by the awesome Gautam Shenoy, but in true celebrity fashion, he escaped the glare of the paparazzi and therefore does not feature in the picture below :( Jokes apart though, I learnt about a lot of new books in this meetup and I hope you all did too.
The following were the books discussed (and yes, this is a Lot of books.</description>

      <description>BBB had our 15th meetup on Sunday, the 26th of August. This was the first meetup that also included a published author Mr.Ram Sivasankaran in our midst and he spoke to us about how he came to be on the path to becoming an author and also about his motivation for the theme of his books, &amp;ldquo;The Lion and the Stallion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Peshwa&amp;rdquo;. Coffee and snacks as usual, amid sounds of the thunderstorm outside, made for an excellent meetup.</description>

      <description>We had 36 people in the last meetup BBB#14 and frankly that&amp;rsquo;s a bit too much :-/ But the discussion was lively, the fries being passed around were awesome and there was hot coffee, so I&amp;rsquo;m partially happy. What would have made me happier is if everyone could have heard Everyone else when they were talking about the books they were reading and that&amp;rsquo;s frankly not possible and feasible for an attending group of this magnitude.</description>

      <description>Oh yessss 🐣 Meetup #13 happened on 22 Apr 2018 and I was very pleased with the eventual turnout, one of the largest we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far. This time we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a theme and that was awesome since the discussion wasn&amp;rsquo;t polarized or monopolized and everyone got their say. And these are the kind of meetups I&amp;rsquo;m personally preferential to, where everyone gets to voice their opinion about books they&amp;rsquo;ve read coz everyone&amp;rsquo;s read Something even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t related to a pre-set theme (not discounting the advantages of the themed meetups, of course.</description>

      <description>Despite the fact that we had to abandon our meetup at Atta Galatta midway and rush to a gazebo outside to resume it, we still managed to have a lively conversation.

      <description>We at Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore had our 2nd meetup of 2018 and 9th meetup in all on Saturday, the 24th of Feb. It was a lot of fun, even the first half of it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. I reached late &amp;hellip;coz..I started late. We had a lot more people join in this time and that fueled most of the conversation.
Some of the books discussed were -
 A Room of One&amp;rsquo;s Own (by Virginia Woolf) Skin in the game (by Nassim Nicholas Taleb) Ready Player One The Elephant in the Brain (by Kevin Simler)  and a smattering of Murakami as always.</description>

      <description>This was the first meetup of 2018 and if spirited conversations, a lot of laughter and smiles all around are any indication, it was a lot of fun. We had a modest gathering of close to 25 people and everyone&amp;hellip;came on time. (Fiine.. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there on time). We went with our usual practice of talking about the last couple of books we&amp;rsquo;d read and with the gathering that we had, a lot of books were discussed.</description>

      <description>So yesterday, we had meetup #4! :) And the usual gang had gathered along with a couple of new faces. We spoke about this and that and books and yes, we ate a lot. (I&amp;rsquo;m so good at summarizing) But, the real takeaway was the collective knowledge of the books we might not have read that we individually and separately had. And we&amp;rsquo;ve made a list of those books this time :)</description>

      <description>This was the first Official meetup. Radhika and I had a better understanding of who had RSVP-ed and what time folks would start spilling in etc. We decided to pick Atta Galatta because Radhika had heard a lot of good things. We met with Palgun, the manager at Atta Galatta (a beloved friend and a quintessential BBB member now, but a relative stranger at the time), who didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what was coming, but accomodated us nonetheless at 3 PM on Apr 16 2017.</description>

      <description>This was the very first unofficial meetup. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other. We didn&amp;rsquo;t even know who was really coming. All we knew was that there was a books By Weight event happening at Basava Bhavan and that a few folks and I from Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore were going to be there. We bought what we could and wound up having lunch at a restaurant opposite the venue. :)</description>
