So yesterday, we had meetup #4! :) And the usual gang had gathered along with a couple of new faces.
We spoke about this and that and books and yes, we ate a lot. 
(I'm so good at summarizing)
But, the real takeaway was the collective knowledge of the books we might not have read that we individually and separately had. And we've made a list of those books this time :)
