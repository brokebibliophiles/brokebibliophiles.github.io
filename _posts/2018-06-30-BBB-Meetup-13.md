Oh yessss üê£ Meetup #13 happened on 22 Apr 2018 and I was very pleased with the eventual turnout, one of the largest we've had so far.
This time we didn't have a theme and that was awesome since the discussion wasn't polarized or monopolized and everyone got their say. And these are the kind of meetups I'm personally preferential to, where everyone gets to voice their opinion about books they've read coz everyone's read Something even if it isn't related to a pre-set theme (not discounting the advantages of the themed meetups, of course. )
A couple of people who had no idea about BBB, tantalized by the amount of noise we were making no doubt, also joined the discussion and that added to the existing flavor, so... Double yay and stuff. ‚úåÔ∏èüòä
All in all, a good meetup.
