There were 17 people at our 24th meetup on the 24th of November and this time, we were joined by the awesome [Gautam Shenoy](https://twitter.com/theBekku), but in true celebrity fashion, he escaped the glare of the paparazzi and therefore does not feature in the picture below :( Jokes apart though, I learnt about a lot of new books in this meetup and I hope you all did too :blush:

This time Mr.Das was an excellent photographer in addition to being an awesome person. (Redemption)
