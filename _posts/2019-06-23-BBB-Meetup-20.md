Today's meetup had 16 members attending and went on for a spirited 3 hours! This time, we switched locations from our regular favorite ([Atta Galatta](https://www.facebook.com/AttaGalattaBookstore/)) to a new bookcafe in the city - [Champaca](http://champaca.in) - and it.was.BEAUTIFUL! The members loved the place and the hosts Radhika, Pavithra and Rahul were awesome! :grin:
