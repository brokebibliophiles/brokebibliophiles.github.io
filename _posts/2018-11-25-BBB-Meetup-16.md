<p> 13 people attended the Nov 25th 2018 BBB Meetup #16 in all and I hope the person who stood up first is still alright at the time of this writing (* chuckles to self *). Moving on. Apart from the fact that the discussion swept across a huuuge number of books as is evident from the list above, we had one other glimmer of awesomeness in that we had Solomon Manoj (who runs the Broke Bibliophiles Chennai chapter) in our midst this time and that was quite the icing on the cake. We also had a couple of newbies attend in addition to some of the oldheads. As always, I had a lot of fun and I hope those of you who attended did too! Thank you all :)
</p>

Until next time!
