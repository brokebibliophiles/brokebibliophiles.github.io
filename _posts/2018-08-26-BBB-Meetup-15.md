BBB had our 15th meetup on Sunday, the 26th of August. This was the first meetup that also included a published author Mr.Ram Sivasankaran in our midst and he spoke to us about how he came to be on the path to becoming an author and also about his motivation for the theme of his books, "The Lion and the Stallion" and "The Peshwa". Coffee and snacks as usual, amid sounds of the thunderstorm outside, made for an excellent meetup.
