:D This was quite the list to compile and as I was listing them out I felt a twinge of guilt at not having recognised close to half of the books :) I'm sure you will too. Pick up a book today! :D

Oh and we wound down the meetup by running across the road from Atta Galatta to Dyu Art Cafe where we wolfed down some good eatables.

Another good meetup :) Thank you, those of you who could make it!

Hope to see some of the rest of you next time :)

PS - A hat tip to Aarzu Sadana for yet again noting down the names of the books and making life a little bit easier for me
