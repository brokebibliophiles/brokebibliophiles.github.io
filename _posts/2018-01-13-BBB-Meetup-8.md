This was the first meetup of 2018 and if spirited conversations, a lot of laughter and smiles all around are any indication, it was a lot of fun. We had a modest gathering of close to 25 people and everyone...came on time. (Fiine.. I wasn't there on time). We went with our usual practice of talking about the last couple of books we'd read and with the gathering that we had, a lot of books were discussed. We had a few new faces ( :) ) and some old heads were absent (-_-) .

Oh, and just in case you were wondering, we ordered a lot of coffee and masala fries and just 2 cheese omelettes. You know you were thinking about that.

PS - Aarzu Sadana was awesome enough to bring her dad along who was an absolute delight to interact with :)
