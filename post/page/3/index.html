      Our 31st meetup in all and our third meetup online was a small informal meetup that quickly escalated into a discussion of books! A lot of history, and non-fiction this time, with a dash of fiction. And that, is one good recipe for an awesome discussion. One of the books on this list opens up closer home,an amazing work of fiction penned by a BBB member and a friend of ours - John Raju :) ; the book in question being The Purgatory of Half Forgotten Riddles.

      The first Meetup of 2020 and our 26th meetup in all, this one had a nice mixture of newbies and regulars. Amid cheesy chilli pops and coffee, much was discussed about the law, Indian authors and much fiction and non-fiction. We even had some people flit in and sit in randomly because they saw us discussing books. Another interesting observation was the reference to books discussed in earlier meetups.

      This was a special meetup for a couple of reasons.
 This was the first meetup that was conducted at a house rather than at a cafe or a park. And when one of our members, Gayathri, generously offered up her art studio as a venue for our meetup I jumped at the offer. I didn&rsquo;t know how it would go because we&rsquo;d always relied on snacks and beverages from a cafe.
